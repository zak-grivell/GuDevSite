<h1>What is a <b>GUDEV</b>?</h1>
<p>We are <b> Glasgow University's Game Development Society.</b></p>
<p>
    We're dedicated to all fields of game development: the programming, the
    music, the art and design, the long sleepless nights spent staring into the
    void.
</p>
<p>
    We're a place for people who want to get into making games to meet and find
    others who can help them build that one game they've wanted to create since
    they were kids.
</p>
<p>
    We're also here to challenge your game development skills with our game jams
    - hackathon style events in which everyone tries to make a video game in a
    couple of days.
